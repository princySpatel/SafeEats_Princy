## 💡 The Problem
For the **40% of people** with food allergies, strict religious diets (Vegetarian/Vegan), or health restrictions, grocery shopping is a nightmare.
* Ingredient labels are tiny and hard to read.
* Industrial names like **"E120"** (Crushed Insects) or **"Rennet"** (Calf Stomach) hide animal products effectively.
* Manual checking is slow and prone to human error.

## 🚀 The Solution
**SafeEats** is an AI-powered mobile web app that acts as your personal dietary guardian.
1.  **Snap a photo** of any food package.
2.  **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** analyzes the text and context in seconds.
3.  **Get an instant verdict:** "Safe", "Unsafe", or "Warning" based on your strict dietary settings.
